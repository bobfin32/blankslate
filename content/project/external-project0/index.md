This first special evaluation study (SES) on Asian Development Bank
(ADB) assistance for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development covers
two decades (1988–2008) of related ADB operations. This SES is intended to provide inputs to
formulating strategies and business plans for implementing further ADB support to PPP
operations in developing member countries (DMCs).
PPP is defined in this SES as a subset of private sector participation (PSP) and includes
all modalities that assume some form of partnership/contractual relationship between the public
sector and private entities with the aim of delivering a public service. The SES evaluates the performance of ADB’s public and
private sector operations in support of PPPs in the power, transport, and water sectors, and the
development of related policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks. The performance
evaluation methodology combines project assessments with assessments of ADB’s strategic
approach, development impact and value addition, and performance. The analysis is based on
(i) findings of a review of all PPP-related public sector operations by the Independent Evaluation
Department (IED), and (ii) evaluations by IED and the Private Sector Operations Department
(PSOD) for completed PPP investments.
