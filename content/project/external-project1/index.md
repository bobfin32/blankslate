The Government of Cambodia has been taking steps to improve the investment climate
and levels of investment in infrastructure. Comprehensive sector development plans for
infrastructure have been prepared, but implementation is constrained by institutional 
weaknesses and limited borrowing capacity.  Publicâ€“private partnership (PPP) can help 
the government meet this financing gap by stimulating private sector investment and 
financing for infrastructure. PPP provides a means to improve efficiency and service 
delivery to users and gain access to new expertise and technology, reducing annual costs 
of infrastructure to the government, and freeing up the fiscal space.It is recommended 
the government implement a phased PPP development program that builds on project successes 
to create political support and investor confidence.
Often, countries that embark on a PPP program are tempted to select projects that
are too ambitious and take shortcuts in an attempt to accelerate the development of
the PPP program and achieve quick results. These actions can lead to costly project
failures and delays for the government, and can be avoided through up-front planning,
institutional capacity building, and appropriate project preparation and management.
