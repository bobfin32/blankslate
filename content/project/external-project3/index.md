Investments in private equity funds (PEFs) are a core activity for the Private Sector
Operations Department (PSOD). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) made its first PEF equity
investment in 1983. Between 1983 and 31 December 2007, investments in a total of 75 PEFs
were approved with a combined value of $900 million. At 31 December 2007, PSOD had 40
active funds with a total approved value of $676.4 million. The increase in the level of 
investment in PEFs within ADBâ€™s operations since the last Operations Evaluation Department 
(OED) evaluation five years ago, the significant size of the PEF portfolio in relative terms 
compared to other peer development agencies, and a forecast increase in PEF approvals in 2008, 
indicate that it is an opportune time to independently reevaluate the PEF portfolio. The 
objective of this special evaluation study is to independently evaluate PEF operations, draw 
lessons, and identify ways in which its contribution to supporting private sector development 
through the use of PEF instruments can be enhanced.
