The EBRD has used equity investments since its founding to catalyse co-investment and firm-level performance improvements in order 
to contribute to wider transition impact. Equity holdings – both direct and in private equity funds -- accounted for 15-20% of 
EBRD’s portfolio from 2005-2016. Equity has received both greater attention and greater scrutiny in recent years. Investment levels 
were ramped up post-crisis in line with an increase in lending. The “Stuck in Transition” report of 2013 argued for greater use of 
instruments such as equity to pursue institutional objectives. Declines in the competitiveness of EBRD debt post-crisis, and a lack 
of equity in countries of operation (COOs), reinforced this view. This evaluation focuses on the Bank’s equity portfolio approach and 
developments between 2005 and 2016. It identifies significant and difficult issues regarding performance and approach, and on the basis 
of these findings makes several recommendations for consideration by Board and Management.
