Large infrastructure financing gaps in EBRD countries of operation (COOs) have long been identified as a key challenge and opportunity for 
the Bank. EBRD estimates COOs annual infrastructure investment need of close to $500bn, well in excess of current levels. The World 
Bank Group estimates that only about half of an annual global investment need of $2000bn is now being met. At a global level the 
international financial institutions have committed to greater support for infrastructure under the Sustainable Development Goals 
and other initiatives related to global public goods. There is increasing recognition that traditional government funding and methods 
are not sufficient to close growing gaps, and increased private sector engagement is now widely understood to be essential.

The EBRD Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility (IPPF) was a high profile initiative approved by the Board in October 2014 to 
scale up infrastructure support, especially for private investment. As a “delivery mechanism to improve the efficiency, quality and 
replicability of infrastructure projects,” the IPPF is meant to help governments build an infrastructure project pipeline using 
additional and improved project preparation support along with policy dialogue. An additional 30 projects were expected to be 
prepared over 2015-17, including both public and privately financed infrastructure using PPPs, and across all countries of operation. 
The IPPF was allocated EUR40mn from the Shareholders Special Fund (SSF) for the period.

On approval of the IPPF the Board requested a stock taking after 3 years. This interim review by the Evaluation Department is intended to 
assess IPPF’s performance against its wider objectives, identifying any early results and difficulties, and its potential to be a co-investment 
multi donor fund for specific countries and sectors. The evaluation provides brief analysis of infrastructure preparation facilities more 
broadly and new instruments to mobilise private finance using Value for Money (VFM) principles; this is intended to provide a larger context 
against which to view IPPF design and performance.
