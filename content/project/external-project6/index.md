Recognition of climate change (CC) as a major global public policy challenge has grown since key concerns were raised in 1992. 
Developed countries were urged to mobilize US$100bn annually by 2020 and a comprehensive framework was agreed in Paris in 2015 
based on enforceable country-level commitments to carbon targets. Against this backdrop EBRD substantially increased the strategic 
priority given to work on sustainability and, more specifically, climate change. Management proposed and the Board approved a 
series of major programmes built around the Bank’s growing ambition to help deliver on the Paris Commitments. The Sustainable 
Energy Initiative (SEI) was approved in 2006 and subsequently widened beyond energy. Green was introduced as a transition priority, 
and the Green Economy Transition initiative (GET) of 2015 committed to a sharp increase in green finance as a share of bank investment.
Climate-related concerns were at the core of each of these initiatives, and were critical in gaining the strong support of shareholders. 
This evaluation focuses principally on their climate dimensions and for this reason refers to them collectively as the Bank’s Climate 
Initiatives. It reviews the main climate initiatives in terms of strategic objectives, operational focus and instruments, 
organization arrangements, portfolio structure, and performance.
