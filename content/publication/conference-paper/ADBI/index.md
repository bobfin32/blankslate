abstract:  The adoption of PPPs creates significant issues for existing public sector management systems at the 
  national and local levels. PPPs are particularly challenging for developing countries, which often
  lack institutional capacity. The PPP project lifecycle does not fit traditional planning, budgeting, implementation,
  monitoring, and evaluation arrangements. PPPs require new methodologies to deveop and manage infrastructure projects. 
  These institutional requirements have been met in different ways across governments in Southeast Asia.
