abstract: Institutional structures and the incentives that they create for shareholders and
  managers have a significant effect on the use of resources. Criteria for assessing
  efficient institutional structures are derived from a theoretical framework based on
  property rights, 'transaction costs, agency costs, and corporate finance theory. The
  rationale as to why cooperatives have been selected to organise agricultural
  marketing and processing activities is discussed. Various problems with producer
  board and cooperative structures and supporting regulations are identified, and
  corporatisation, deregulation and privatisation issues are then evaluated in terms of
  acting as a possible panacea for these problems.
