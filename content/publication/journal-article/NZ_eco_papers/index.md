abstract: The paper provides a quantitative analysis of New Zealand's export demand elasticities for commodities such 
  as dairy and meat products. These elasticities provide a measure of market power, and it can be argued that where NZ 
  has market power (inelastic demand) then monopoly export rights held by proucer boards are justified. The study did 
  not find any evidence supporting the presence of market power and the value of monopoly export rights.
