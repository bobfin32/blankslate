abstract: The Government of Cambodia has been taking steps to improve the investment climate
  and levels of investment in infrastructure. Comprehensive sector development plans for
  infrastructure have been prepared, but implementation is constrained by institutional 
  weaknesses and limited borrowing capacity.  Publicâ€“private partnership (PPP) can help 
  the government meet this financing gap by stimulating private sector investment and 
  financing for infrastructure. PPP provides a means to improve efficiency and service 
  delivery to users and gain access to new expertise and technology, reducing annual costs 
  of infrastructure to the government, and freeing up the fiscal space. It is recommended 
  the government implement a phased PPP development program that builds on project successes 
  to create political support and investor confidence.
