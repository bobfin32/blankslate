abstract: Investments in private equity funds (PEFs) are a core activity for the Private Sector
  Operations Department (PSOD). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) made its first PEF equity
  investment in 1983. Between 1983 and 31 December 2007, investments in a total of 75 PEFs
  were approved with a combined value of $900 million. At 31 December 2007, PSOD had 40
  active funds with a total approved value of $676.4 million. The objective of this special 
  evaluation study is to independently evaluate PEF operations, draw lessons, and identify ways 
  in which its contribution to supporting private sector development through the use of PEF instruments 
  can be enhanced.
