abstract: This first special evaluation study (SES) on Asian Development Bank
  (ADB) assistance for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development covers
  two decades (1988–2008) of related ADB operations. This SES is intended to provide inputs to
  formulating strategies and business plans for implementing further ADB support to PPP
  operations in developing member countries (DMCs). The SES evaluates the performance of ADB’s public and
  private sector operations in support of PPPs in the power, transport, and water sectors, and the
  development of related policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks. The performance
  evaluation methodology combines project assessments with assessments of ADB’s strategic
  approach, development impact and value addition, and performance.
