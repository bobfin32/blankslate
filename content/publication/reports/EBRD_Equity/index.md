abstract: EBRD has used equity investments since its founding to catalyse co-investment and firm-level 
  performance improvements in order to contribute to wider transition impact. This evaluation focusses on 
  the Bankâ€™s equity portfolio approach and developments between 2005 and 2016. It identifies significant and 
  difficult issues regarding performance and approach, and on the basis of these findings makes several 
  recommendations for consideration by Board and Management.
