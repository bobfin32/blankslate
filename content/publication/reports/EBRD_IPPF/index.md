abstract: EBRD's Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility (IPPF) was a high profile initiative approved by the Board 
  in October 2014 to scale up infrastructure support, especially for private investment. As a “delivery mechanism to 
  improve the efficiency, quality and replicability of infrastructure projects,” the IPPF is meant to help governments 
  build an infrastructure project pipeline using additional and improved project preparation support along with policy 
  dialogue. An additional 30 projects were expected to be prepared over 2015-17, including both public and privately 
  financed infrastructure using PPPs, and across all countries of operation. The IPPF was allocated EUR40mn from the 
  Shareholders Special Fund (SSF) for the period. On approval of the IPPF the Board requested a stock taking after 3 
  years. This interim review by the Evaluation Department is intended to assess IPPF’s performance against its wider 
  objectives, identifying any early results and difficulties, and its potential to be a co-investment multi donor fund 
  for specific countries and sectors. The evaluation provides brief analysis of infrastructure preparation facilities 
  more broadly and new instruments to mobilise private finance using Value for Money (VFM) principles; this is intended 
  to provide a larger context against which to view IPPF design and performance.
