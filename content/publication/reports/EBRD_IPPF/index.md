abstract: EBRD's Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility (IPPF) was a high profile initiative approved by the Board 
  in October 2014 to scale up infrastructure support, especially for private investment. As a “delivery mechanism to 
  improve the efficiency, quality and replicability of infrastructure projects,” the IPPF is meant to help governments 
  build an infrastructure project pipeline using additional and improved project preparation support along with policy 
  dialogue. This interim review by the Evaluation Department assess' IPPF’s performance against its wider 
  objectives, identifying early results and difficulties, and its potential to be a co-investment multi donor fund 
  for specific countries and sectors. The evaluation provides a brief analysis of infrastructure preparation facilities 
  more broadly and new instruments to mobilise private finance using Value for Money (VFM) principles.
