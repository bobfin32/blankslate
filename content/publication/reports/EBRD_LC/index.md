abstract: This evaluation is focused on EBRD's Local Capital Market (LCM) development work under the Strategy. It does 
  not assess the substantial amount of work focused on local currency activities, though in many cases this may have 
  had secondary LCM dimensions. It confirms that considerable effort and skill has gone into delivering specific 
  transactions and Technical Cooperation in challenging contexts, resulting in discrete  accomplishments in numerous 
  cases. The commitment to a higher institutional profile and priority at the level of sector and country strategy and 
  operations laid out in the Strategy depends on the content of new-format country strategies and is not yet observable.
  Solid evidence of wider contributions to LCM is limited.There appears to be a significant disconnect between, on the 
  one hand, the Bankâ€™s high but undefined strategic ambitions for the complex task of transforming local capital markets
  and, on the other, its sharply limited actual capacity to accomplish this given choices it has made about resourcing, 
  prioritisation, organization, and collaboration with other institutions.
