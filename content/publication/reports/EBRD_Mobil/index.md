abstract: Mobilisation of incremental private sector finance by the multilateral development institutions has always 
  been at the core of their public purpose. The study seeks to contribute to EBRD's Board and Management understanding, 
  strategic thinking and operational decision-making about the Bankâ€™s role in mobilising additional private capital 
  to support transition. The study begins by providing essential background information, including details on the instruments used, and current MDB 
  strategies, practice and outcomes; key findings of existing performance assessments and evaluations. The balance of the 
  paper then looks closely at mobilisation practices and issues specific to EBRD and opportunities to enhance its performance.
