abstract: Mobilisation of incremental private sector finance by the multilateral development institutions has always 
  been formally at the core of their public purpose. In some it is explicitly established as a central objective; 
  EBRD’s Articles specifically do so, as do the founding Articles of the World Bank, IFC and other comparator 
  institutions. The study seeks to contribute to Board and Management understanding, strategic thinking and operational 
  decision-making about the Bank’s role in mobilising additional private capital to support transition. Organisationally 
  it begins by providing essential factual background, including details on the instruments used, and current MDB 
  strategies, practice and outcomes; key findings of existing performance assessments and evaluations. The bulk of the 
  paper then looks closely at mobilisation practices and issues specific to EBRD and its performance.
